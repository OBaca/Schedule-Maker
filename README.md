## Description

 Crafting dynamic schedules and implementing automated worker
 assignments, empowering your team to maximize productivity while
 easing the burden on management.
 * Create a Google Form so workers can input their constraints for the next week.
 * The manager clicks on a single button, and voil√†, a working schedule for the next week is generated.

   
 In this schedule, we take into consideration:

 * The manager can choose the maximum number of shifts a worker can work in a week.
 * The Google Form adjusts the workers' constraints so that it doesn't assign a specific worker to a shift they can't work.
 * The worker can also add comments if they have special requests, which will be highlighted for the manager.
 * The manager can choose the maximum amount of night shifts for each worker.
 * The manager can decide if a worker can work two nights in a row or not.
 * The manager can choose the number of 8-8 shifts (8 hours of work, 8 hours of rest, 8 hours of work).
 * If none of the workers can work a certain shift, a backup worker will be assigned. The manager can choose to replace it with a regular worker or call for backup.
 * The manager can determine the number of shifts each day and the number of stands.
 * The manager can modify the labels of the constraints for their convenience.
 * The end result will display the schedule for the next week alongside the workers' constraints.
